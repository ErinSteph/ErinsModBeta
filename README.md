# ErinsMod Beta

## This is currently a closed beta.
What this means is you need to be whitelisted for access both via KSL and to the github repo.

### I will need: 

- Your SteamID64, so i can whitelist you to use the mod in KSL, [use this site to find it](https://www.steamidfinder.com/).

- Your Github account username, so i can grant you access to the file download while the beta remains closed. This website you are on right now is github, make an account here if you don't have one already.

Send me those in a DM, get frustrated im sleeping and you're waiting hours, and i'll let you know when it's done.
